Above code is creating segment tree in array. it is constructing tree in **bottom up** style.

After creating tree now you can search for min value in given range.
To search you need to remeber **three rule**.
1. __partial overlap__ == you search(go down) and look for both side
2. __total overlap__ == it means that your query range is bigger than subtree so you return the minvalue at that subtree root
3. __no overlap__ == you don't care you return Max value
